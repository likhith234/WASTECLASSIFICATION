#Introduction
This repo is for building an AI mode  to develop a CNN model to classify images of plastic waste into different categories 
This project is been done by myself and with the help of edunet virtual internship project 
#Data Set
The link of the data set is being provided, because of the large size of the data i am unable to upload it in the github

#Week 1
So for my week 1 project is based on data visualization of the data set 
1) Displaying the image with its lable
2) Displaying the images with its labels in the form of grid to know the diversity
3) Visualization of the image dimension distribution in histogram
4) Visualization of the data proportion using the bar chat
5) Visualization of the data proportion using the pie chat(demonstrated in master class)
6) Visualization of image width and height  using the Scatter plot

Observation:
1)The images consists of recyclable and organinc materials
2)The images pixels comprises from 100 to 400
3)In pie chat we can see that the organic images occupy 55.69% and the recyclable images occupy 44.31%
4)In the histogram we can that the organic images are above 12000 and recyclable images are around 10000
